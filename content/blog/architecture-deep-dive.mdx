# LookOut Deep Dive: Architecture and Design Choices

LookOut is officially available. It's a monitoring service I built to solve a specific problem: keeping free-tier apps awake and tracking basic uptime.

## What It Does

- **Keeps apps awake**: Regular pings to prevent your Heroku/Render/Railway apps from sleeping
- **Basic monitoring**: Track uptime and response times with simple charts
- **Free to use**: Monitor up to 35 endpoints across 5 workspaces
- **Export data**: Download your monitoring data in JSON, CSV, or Excel

## Why I Built This

My side projects kept sleeping on free hosting platforms. When sharing portfolio links, there was always that awkward "Your app is starting up..." moment.

Existing monitoring tools either cost money or were too complex for simple projects. I needed something that would:

1. Ping my apps every few minutes
2. Show basic uptime stats  
3. Not require enterprise-level setup

## Current Features

### Monitoring
- HTTP endpoint monitoring (GET, POST, etc.)
- Custom headers and request bodies
- 5-minute to 1-hour check frequencies
- Response time tracking

### Organization
- 5 workspaces per user
- 7 endpoints per workspace
- Simple dashboard with charts

### Data Export
- JSON, CSV, Excel, and PDF formats
- Historical data access
- No vendor lock-in

<Callout type="info">
**Honest disclaimer**: This is a side project. It works well for basic monitoring needs, but it's not enterprise-grade infrastructure monitoring.
</Callout>

## Getting Started

1. Sign up at [lookoutapi.xyz](/)
2. Add your endpoint URL
3. Configure check frequency
4. That's it

Setup takes about 2 minutes. No credit card required.

## What's Next

I'm planning to add:
- Slack/Discord notifications
- Status page generation
- API access
- Team collaboration features

Timeline depends on usage and feedback.

## Technical Details

- Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase
- Monitoring workers across multiple locations
- 90 days of detailed logs, 1 year of aggregated stats
- Response times under 100ms for dashboard loads

## Try It Out

LookOut is free and available now. If you're a developer with apps on free hosting tiers, it might be useful.
